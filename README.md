# Twitter API Client

This project is a simple Python-based Twitter client that allows you to post and delete tweets using the [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) library and the Twitter API. 

The project is split into two main scripts:
- `post_tweet.py` for posting a tweet.
- `delete_tweet.py` for deleting a tweet by its ID.

Sensitive API tokens are stored securely in a `.env` file to prevent exposure.
